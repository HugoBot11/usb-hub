I started using the USB hub jam tutorial. I placed the usb ports and the microcontroller and started wiring. I also learned what nets are and how to use them, and I placed some capacitors and a diode

# August 26th: Finished shematic and PCB

Today I finished the schematic and expanded from the tutorial by adding 2 more female USB ports to my hub. I then started designing my pcb and I learned a lot about traces and how to place vias. I also added some silkscreen to my PCB.
